{"id":12,"count":20,"description":"<p>The Deferred object, introduced in jQuery 1.5, is a chainable utility object created by calling the <a href=\"\/jQuery.Deferred\/\"><code>jQuery.Deferred()<\/code><\/a> method. It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.<\/p>\n    <p>The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.<\/p>","link":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/deferred-object\/","name":"Deferred Object","slug":"deferred-object","taxonomy":"category","parent":0,"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories\/12","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/category"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts?categories=12"},{"href":"https:\/\/api.jquery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages?categories=12"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
